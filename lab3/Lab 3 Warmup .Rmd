```
Vector for Plant Height 
```{r}
plant_height <- c(30.7,37.6,28.4,NA,33.2)
```
Vector for Plant Weight
```{r}
plant_mass <-c(4,5.2,3.7,NA,4.6)
```

Naming Rows for Matrix
```{r}
plant_names <- c("Plant1 1","Plant 2", "Plant 3", "Plant 4", "Plant 5")
measured <- c("height","weight")
```

Combine data for height and weight
```{r}
plant_experiment<- c(plant_height,plant_mass)
plant_experiment
```

Build Data matrix
```{r}
Plant_matrix <- matrix(plant_experiment,nrow=5,byrow=F)
Plant_matrix
```
Name Columns and Rows
```{r}
colnames(Plant_matrix) <- measured
rownames(Plant_matrix) <- plant_names
```

Print Matrix
```{r}
Plant_matrix
```

Calculate column means
```{r}
plant_means<- colMeans(Plant_matrix,na.rm=FALSE,)
plant_means
```
