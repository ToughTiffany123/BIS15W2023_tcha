## Review from last time
### *With a partner, discuss the following questions*
1. How did the midterm go? Did you learn anything while doing the exam?


I did not think the midterm went well. I lacked a lot of functions and methods to rely on for some questions. I felt like I did not even have enough time to use the cheat sheet I had made before class. I also was unable to commit the first version of my test after the halfway mark which really lowered my morale in this class. However, I'm in this class to introduce myself to coding and realize I am very slow at coding. I learned how to commit files on github on the in-class computer and how to use '-' instead of '!=' for taking out specific columns out of the data set.

2. Where did you get stuck?


I got stuck on questions 4 and 8 because I was unable to think about what to compare the large_mass ducks to.
3. What do we need to practice?


I think I need to practice recalling certain functions I can use to answer questions and possibly practice dplyer, group_by, summarize, and tabyl.

### Warm-up
1. Please install the package `naniar`.
