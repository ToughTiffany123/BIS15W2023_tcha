## Instructions
Answer the following questions in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.



## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation?  


A Bachelor's Degreeis typical for most data scientists. It is also a growing occupation with a 36% higher growth rate than the average occupation growth.


2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 


Currently, I have experience searching online for data and importing data from online sources. I am able to clean data to prepare for analysis with transparency and can  understanding how to organize my code for others to follow my process of cleaning. I also understand how to graph plots and map data on a geographical terrain. I have some familiarity using ggplot and shiny apps.


3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)


I am currently interested in doing research on microorganisms, so R helps me understand what I can do with data that has already been collected. I can also create graphs about my data to present the results of my research. 


4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?


I had trouble with the final project because I faced several issues which were not exactly taught in class, so I had to go to the internet and search up how other people did it. However, now I feel alot more confident with my computer skills since I had to troubleshoot many things for coding and essentially find the solution on my own using the internet or my notes.


I think the hardest part about coding was the unfamiliarity I felt as I saw interfaces and learning to use my computer to start coding. Organization was rough because I did not know how files were stored on my laptop and I had no idea how to search for help online. The amount of coding we learned was also overwhelming and I was too focused on memorizing the code rather than understanding the code conceptually. Understanding the code conceptually is better, since you would then  have the understanding to google a similar working code and make sure formatting is correct.



5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class.


I wish I knew that coding was not meant to be memorized but rather understood conceptually.


6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?


I would like to have learned more about importing different files onto R rather than just csv.


7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to persue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?


I don't plan on pursuing a job as a data scientists; however, these skills may come into use when I analyze my own data.


8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?


It was extremely important since I had someone to go to when I was stuck (which happened often). If this class were to be online, then I would find my learning to be very limited since I would have to rely on the internet a whole lot more.


9. Did you complete the class evaluation? Please complete the class evaluation using the link provided in the announcements. Your feedback is very important and we appreciate your time.

I completed the class evaluation.
